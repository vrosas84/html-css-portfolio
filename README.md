# html-css-portfolio
Personal portfolio website. Modified from template in README

Template website. Using this for my personal portfolio website to relearn HTML, CSS, and JS. 
Used Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5ejyIOKbNM) and tweaked it a bit to match my personal color palate
Made some additional modifications to layout. Nothing severe, just tweaked the spaces. 
Left personal photos and documents in there so it can be downloaded and viewed immediately without needing to provide your own content.
Please don't pass my content or info off as your own. The design is not mine so copy/modify at your pleasure, but the content is mine

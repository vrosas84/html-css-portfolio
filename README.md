# html-css-portfolio
Personal portfolio website. Modified from template in README

Template website. Using this for my personal portfolio website to relearn HTML, CSS, and JS. 
Used Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5ejyIOKbNM) and tweaked it a bit to match my personal color palate
Made some additional modifications to layout. Nothing severe, just tweaked the spaces.
